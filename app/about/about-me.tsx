                Currently, I'm a Software Engineer employed 
                at <a className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.introhive.com/">Introhive</a> focusing
                on improving client's data and their daily workflows. I work on automating and improving the quality of client's data in CRM. This attributes to higher
                confidence in their data, enabling them to make informed business decisions. My work varies between frontend and backend which I enjoy as it 
                always surfaces new challenges for me to tackle.

                I have had the opportunity to work in diverse environments ranging from retail to technology. My client-facing roles shaped a strong, 
                client driven approach to problem-solving. I carry that mindset into my daily workflows, ensuring the work I do is intentional and creates real value.

                Outside of work, you can find me spending time with my fiancée and two dogs, working on our property, working out, and jamming to all sorts of music!
